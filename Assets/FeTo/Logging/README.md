# FeTo Logger

FeTo offers you a custom logger that:

* Makes sure that no logs are created on the Build version.
* Allows to activate / deactivate logs generated by FeTo tools themselves.

## How to use FeTo logger in your code:
_Since internally it keeps using Unity's Debug class, all it's utilities are still available_

Logger is an static class that exposes 3 public methods:
```c#
public static void Info(string message);
public static void Warn(string message);
public static void Error(string message);
```

So feel free to use as follows:
```c#
Logger.Info("My log Message");
```

It's possible that the compiler finde Looger ambiguous, un sucn case, simply add the following
```c#
using Logger = FeTo.Logging.Logger;
```

## How to activate logs for FeTo tools.

In case you need to track events being raised, catched or even when a listener starts or stops listening to an event (among other FeTo tools), you must first define the compilation Symbol "FETO_LOGS".

`Edit > Project Settings ... > Player > Other Settings > Script Compilation > Scripting Define Symbols > +`

Once activated, you simply need to go to the trackable FeTo tool and activate its events.

Right now, trackable tools are:
* GameEvents
* RuntimeSets
